===============================

This project is a template for installing and running [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) with the '[wp-svbtle](https://github.com/gravityonmars/wp-svbtle)' theme. The repository comes bundled with [PostgreSQL for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/postgresql-for-wordpress/) and [WP Read-Only](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpro/).

Installation
============

Clone the repository from Github

    $ git clone git://github.com/webjames/heroku-wordpress-svbtle.git
    
With the [Heroku gem](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command), create your app

    $ cd heroku-wordpress-svbtle
    $ heroku create
    > Creating strange-turtle-1234... done, stack is cedar
    > http://strange-turtle-1234.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:strange-turtle-1234.git
    > Git remote heroku added

Add a database to your app

    $ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev
    > Adding heroku-postgresql:dev to strange-turtle-1234... done, v2 (free)
	> Attached as HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_COLOR
	> Database has been created and is available
	> Use `heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql:dev` to view documentation

Promote the database (replace COLOR with the color name from the above output)

	$ heroku pg:promote HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_COLOR
	> Promoting HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_COLOR to DATABASE_URL... done

Add SendGrid to your app - optional, to enable email.

    $ heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter

Create a new branch for any configuration/setup changes needed

    $ git checkout -b production
    
Copy the `wp-config.php`

    $ cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php

Clear `.gitignore` and commit `wp-config.php`

    $ >.gitignore
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Initial WordPress commit"
    
Deploy to Heroku

    $ git push heroku production:master
    > -----> Heroku receiving push
    > -----> PHP app detected
    > -----> Bundling Apache v2.2.22
    > -----> Bundling PHP v5.3.10
    > -----> Discovering process types

    >
    > To git@heroku:strange-turtle-1234.git
    > * [new branch]    production -> master 

After deployment WordPress has a few more steps to setup:

Follow the Wordpress setup

Enable the theme from the admin panel

Log in to http://your-app-url.herokuapp.com/wp-svbtle for a new blogging experience!


Media Uploads
===
[WP Read-Only](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpro/) plugin is included in the repository allowing the use of [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for media uploads.

1. Activate the plugin under 'Plugins', if not already activated.
2. Input your Amazon S3 credentials in 'Settings'->'WPRO Settings'.


Usage
========

* Because a file cannot be written to Heroku's file system, updating and installing plugins or themes should be done locally and then pushed to Heroku.
* To run WordPress locally on Mac OS X try [MAMP](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_Locally_on_Your_Mac_With_MAMP).

Updating
========

Updating your WordPress version is just a matter of merging the updates into
the branch created from the installation.

    $ git pull # Get the latest

Using the same branch name from our installation:

    $ git checkout production
    $ git merge master # Merge latest
    $ git push heroku production:master

WordPress needs to update the database. After push, navigate to:

    http://your-app-url.herokuapp.com/wp-admin

WordPress will prompt for updating the database. After that you'll be good
to go.

If you get 404 errors on viewing single posts, you will need to re-save your 'Permalink Settings' under Settings -> Permalinks. Just hit save, no need to change anything.

Custom Domains
==============

Heroku allows you to add custom domains to your site hosted with them.  To add your custom domain, enter in the follow commands.

    $ heroku domains:add www.example.com
    > Added www.example.com as a custom domain name to myapp.heroku.com

You'll also want to cover the non "www" side of the url.

    $ heroku domains:add example.com
    > Added example.com as a custom domain name to myapp.heroku.com

Once Heroku recognizes your custom domain(s) you'll then need to setup separate DNS A records for the following ip addresses to point to your domain:

    75.101.163.44
    75.101.145.87
    174.129.212.2

Once the DNS A records propagate, then simply test out your change by hitting the url in the browser to make sure you are good to go.  If you are in need of cheap DNS hosting then I would recommend [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/r/571e28804df06f).

The last step is updating your WordPress installation to recognize the new domain.  You'll need to open up the WordPress Admin Dashboard and go to Settings --> General.  From there just update the URL for the WordPress address and you're done.

If you find yourself running into problems, there is a guide posted in the Heroku Docs which can be found [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains).


Local Development
=================

Note: this has only been tested on a Mac, but it should work on any environment.

First, make sure your Apache is running (you should see something when you hit [http://localhost](http://localhost).
You should also make sure that PHP5 module is enabled in ```/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf```. Uncomment this line in the config
if it is commented out:

    LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

You may optionally want to change some settings in your php.ini file (located at ```/private/etc/php.ini.default``` - copy/rename this file to ```php.ini```), but this is not
necessary.

Create a new virtual host file for your blog in ```/private/etc/apache2/other```. Here is a sample vhost that you can start with.

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName mycool.blog
        ServerAlias *.mycool.blog
        DocumentRoot "/Users/username/Sites/mycool-blog"

        SetEnv DATABASE_URL "postgres://user:pw@127.0.0.1/mycool-blog"

        <Directory "/Users/username/Sites/mycool-blog">
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

Change the *ServerName*, *ServerAlias*, *DocumentRoot* and *username* values to reflect your own local environment. We'll get
to the *SetEnv DATABASE_URL* in a minute.

In order to use the ```mycool.blog``` domain locally, you will need to add it to your ```/etc/hosts``` file. So just add an
entry to it like so (you will need to sudo to modify this file.)

    127.0.0.1       mycool.blog
    
Now that we have Apache running locally, enabled the PHP5 module, created a vhost for our blog and added a hosts entry for it,
we can now restart Apache.

    $ sudo apachectl restart

If you look in the ```wp-config.php``` file, you will notice that the ```DATABASE_URL``` environment variable is first read from the
```$_ENV``` variable (which is defined and used by Heroku), and if that does not exist, it will try to read it using ```getenv()```, which
we have defined in our Apache vhost setting above. The next step involves setting up Postgres locally.

The simplest way to get Postgres up and running locally is to use this app: [postgresapp.com](http://postgresapp.com)

Optionally, you can also download the PgAdmin app to help you manage your database. [PgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/download/macosx.php)

Once you have created your database locally, you can then set the ```DATABASE_URL``` value and you should be all set to go. Setting
up and database and roles is outside the scope of this README, however there is great documentation on the postgresapp and pgadmin sites
to help you get that sorted out.
